## 👨‍💻 About Me
I’m Michealking (*BuildsWithKing*), a Solidity smart contract developer on a mission:  
- Shipped *25+ projects* in under 7 months.  
- Building *open-source security modules* from scratch (e.g., [Kingable](https://github.com/BuildsWithKing/buildswithking-security/blob/main/contracts/access/core/Kingable.sol),
  [KingReentrancyGuard](https://github.com/BuildsWithKing/buildswithking-security/blob/main/contracts/security/ReentrancyGuard.sol),
  [KingReentrancyAttacker](https://github.com/BuildsWithKing/buildswithking-security/blob/main/contracts/access/utils/KingReentrancyAttacker.sol)).  
- Practicing *Foundry testing* (unit, fuzz, invariant).  
- Exploring *gas optimizations* & real-world security patterns.
