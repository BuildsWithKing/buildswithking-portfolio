## 🚀 About Me
I’m Michealking (*BuildsWithKing*), a Solidity smart contract developer on a mission:  
- Shipped *20+ projects* in under 6 months.  
- Building *open-source security modules* from scratch (e.g., [Kingable](https://github.com/BuildsWithKing/buildswithking-security/blob/main/contracts/access/Kingable.sol), [ReentrancyGuard](https://github.com/BuildsWithKing/buildswithking-security/blob/main/contracts/security/ReentrancyGuard.sol)).  
- Practicing *Foundry testing* (unit, fuzz, invariant).  
- Exploring *gas optimizations* & real-world security patterns.
